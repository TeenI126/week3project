# Problem Domain Description
Our team will be looking into the media management domain.

# What kind of application we are planning to make
We plan to make an app to manage and share music across different streaming platforms, for example sharing a playlist from Apple Music to Spotify.
This will require the user to authenticate our app with multiple APIs for streaming services.

# Link to API documentation we could use
